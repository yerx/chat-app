# The Event App

The project enables anyone to create an event and sell tickets without having to pay exorbitant service fees that other platforms charge and without having to give away their data. The events will have a ticket price and ticket supply.

There are three user types. The event host puts on the event. The ticket holders users purchase tickets to attend the event. The third user is the arbitrator who will release the funds from the ticket purchases to the event host after the event host delivers on the goods or services advertised. The roadmap for the project includes having different UIs for each user type. 

## Getting Started
